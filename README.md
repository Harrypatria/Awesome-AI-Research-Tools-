## Tips for Using AI Tools as an Expert

- **Verify Outputs**: Always cross-check AI-generated content with original sources to avoid hallucinations or biases.
- **Combine Tools**: Use literature search tools first, then PDF interactors for deep dives, and writing aids for polishing—chain them for efficiency.
- **Privacy and Ethics**: Opt for tools with data privacy features, especially for sensitive research; cite AI usage transparently in papers.
- **Customize Prompts**: For chatbots, use specific, structured prompts (e.g., "Summarize key findings from [paper] in bullet points") to get better results.
- **Integrate with Workflows**: Leverage browser extensions and API integrations to embed AI seamlessly into your daily research routine.
- **Stay Updated**: Follow GitHub repos and AI news on X for new tools; test free tiers before committing to premiums.
- **Handle Limitations**: AI excels at pattern recognition but struggles with novel insights—use it as an assistant, not a replacement for human expertise.
- **Collaborate Safely**: When sharing, use tools with collaboration features but ensure compliance with institutional policies on AI.
